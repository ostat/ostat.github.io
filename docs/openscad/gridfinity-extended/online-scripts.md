# Gridfinity Extended Online

For the best performance you can download the repo and run the scripts in OpenSCAD application on your PC. However, thanks to the work by [openscad-wasm](https://github.com/openscad/openscad-wasm){:target="_blank"} and seasick's [openscad-web-gui](https://github.com/seasick/openscad-web-gui){:target="_blank"} you can also open the scripts in the browser.
Currently some features don't work in the browser. Specifically any of the preview features including colouring, calipers and debug slice will not work.

## Online scripts
 - [Official Gridfinity Extended on MakerWorld Customiser](https://makerworld.com/en/models/481168){:target="_blank"}<br>
 - [Gridfinity Extended - Basic Cup](https://seasick.github.io/openscad-web-gui/?https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fostat%2Fgridfinity_extended_openscad%2Fmain%2Fcombined%2Fgridfinity_basic_cup.scad){:.buster target="_blank"}
