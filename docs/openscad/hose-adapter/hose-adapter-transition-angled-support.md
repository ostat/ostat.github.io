## Transition Support For Angled Adapters
![vacuum_hose_adapter transitionbase](/assets/openscad/hose-adapters/vacuum_hose_adapter-transitionbase_text.gif){:.wrap-lightbox  width="500" }
<br>The base support is intended to assist in printing the adapter allowing the for less support by orientating it on the bend. This wont work for all configurations, and often some support is still needed for angled adapters.<br>
