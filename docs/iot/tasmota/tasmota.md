# Rules
For a single button multi output power strip. By default the button won't turn on or off all relays.
- `button1#state=3`: Trigger on long press.
- `SetOption1 1`: Restrict button actions to press and hold. Prevents accidental reset with long press.
- `SetOption32 20`: Set long press time to 20 seconds
- `Backlog`: Command/line contains multiple commands.

```
Backlog ButtonTopic 0; SetOption1 1; SetOption32 20
```

On long press turn everything off (regardless of what the sate is).
``` 
ON button1#state=3 DO power0 0 ENDON
```

On long press, if any relays is on turn all off, if all are off turn all on.<BR>
Solution uses a variable to record if anything is on.
```
ON System#Boot DO var1 0 ENDON
ON power1#state=1 DO Add1 1 ENDON
ON power2#state=1 DO Add1 1 ENDON
ON power3#state=1 DO Add1 1 ENDON
ON power4#state=1 DO Add1 1 ENDON
ON power1#state=0 DO Sub1 1 ENDON
ON power2#state=0 DO Sub1 1 ENDON
ON power3#state=0 DO Sub1 1 ENDON
ON power4#state=0 DO Sub1 1 ENDON
ON Var1#State>4 DO Var1 4 ENDON
ON Var1#State<0 DO Var1 0 ENDON
ON Var1#State>0 DO Var2 0 ENDON
ON Var1#State==0 DO Var2 1 ENDON
ON button1#state=3 DO power0 %var2% ENDON
```
